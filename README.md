# lm4f120x1_freertos
My starting files for a FreeRTOS project in the TI Stellaris LaunchPad.

The makefiles are all broken, but soon I'll fix it.
This repository still have some Texas Instruments code that are under an ungly license. I may update it either adding them as submodules or removing them as dependencies.
